    "Nome": "Carlac",
    "Descrição": "The frigid world of Carlac is a desolate place, dominated by a glacial landscape, ice-covered caverns, and perpetual snowfall. Those who wander here quickly find no other signs of life. In the age of the Republic, the snow-draped world in the Outer Rim Territories avoided much of the violence of the Clone Wars. But when the nomadic Death Watch warriors turned it into a camp, the planet and its peaceful Ming Po people faced death and destruction. Chieftain Pieter, leader of the Ming Po, demanded that Death Watch leave Carlac at once, unleashing the cruel temper of Pre Vizsla.",
