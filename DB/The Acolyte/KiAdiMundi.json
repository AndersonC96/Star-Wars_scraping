    "Nome": "Ki-Adi-Mundi",
    "Descrição": "Ki-Adi-Mundi was a Cerean alien who sat on the Jedi Council. A humanoid being, Ki's most distinguishing physical feature was an enlarged conical cranium that contained a binary brain. When Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn reported a Sith attack during the events surrounding the Battle of Naboo, Ki-Adi-Mundi expressed shock at the notion. \"Impossible,\" he remarked, \"the Sith have been extinct for a millennium.\" He also failed to see how far Count Dooku had fallen from the Jedi ideals just prior to the Clone Wars, believing that Dooku was incapable of violence or murder.",
