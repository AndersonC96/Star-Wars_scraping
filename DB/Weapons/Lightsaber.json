    "Descrição": "The lightsaber is the weapon of a Jedi, an elegant weapon of a more civilized age. It can be used to cut through blast doors or enemies alike. Using the Force, a Jedi can predict and deflect incoming blaster bolts, and reflect them.",
    "História": "While most lightsabers have a simple metal hilt with one blade, others can be more complex and feature salient designs.Darth Maulwielded a deadly double-bladed lightsaber, allowing him to parry easily in his duel withObi-Wan KenobiandQui-Gon Jinn.\n\nAlthough use of the lightsaber is the mark of a Jedi, it is also used by their sworn enemies, theSith. Typically, a Jedi’s lightsaber blade is colored green or blue. Other colors are rare but possible, most notably seen with Jedi MasterMace Windu’s purple blade. Sith uniformly use red-bladed lightsabers -- an intense, aggressive color that represents their view of the Force.\n\nAn essential rite of passage for young Jedi is the Gathering. In the Gathering, younglings go to the frigid ice worldIlum, where they search forkyber crystalsto build their first lightsabers. The crystals are located in the planet’s Crystal Cave, an intimidating maze, and “call out” to the Jedi they are in tune with. Once the correct crystal has been found, younglings rendezvous withHuyang, and ancient droid who chooses the parts necessary to build a lightsaber. With everything in place, younglings complete the ritual by constructing their Jedi weapons through a graceful use of the Force.\n\nThe lightsaber is a complex instrument consisting of a pommel cap, hand grip, control module, main hilt, focusing lens, and blade emitter, with an energy core powered by a kyber crystal.(Illustrations courtesy ofStar Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia)",
