    "Nome": "Indara",
    "Descrição": "Master Indara is a Jedi Master of great physical and mental skill. She has exacting control of her Force abilities, exuding a sense of command and authority with just her presence. Though she does not seek combat, she is skilled enough to engage on her own terms.",
    "História": "Toward the end ofThe High Republic, MasterIndaraand her PadawanTorbinserved on a mission to the world ofBrendok. Leading a crew that also included Jedi KnightSoland MasterKelnacca, the team investigated the possibility of a vergence inThe Force. The world of Brendok was teeming with life despite being struck by the Emergences that destroyed entire civilizations in the wake of the Great Hyperspace Disaster. But after the discovery of a coven of witches and their young twins,MaeandOsha Aniseya, everything changed. Indara and her team entered the witches’ fortress on the night of a special ritual called Ascension. Soon after, Torbin intruded on the fortress for a second time, forcing Indara and the others to chase him down to prevent him from acting brashly. In the aftermath, Torbin was badly injured, the fortress was set on fire, and, of the witches, only Osha was thought to have survived.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome 16 years later, however, Indara learned she had been mistaken. On the world ofUeda, Indara encountered Mae in a noodle shop. The two fought hand-to-hand and dagger-to-Lightsaberuntil, distracted by saving a stray blade from killing an innocent bystander, Indara was killed by a dagger to the heart.",
